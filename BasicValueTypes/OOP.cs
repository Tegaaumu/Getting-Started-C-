//// object oriented programming is a programming paradigm
//// that uses objects and classes in programming 
//// we can structure a program by bundling related
//// properties ans behaviours into individual objects
//// this means that for the first time we start to think
//// about our programs less like just a series of steps
//// and more like a collection of things that interact!

//// in C# we can create by using the class keyword

//// we can create an object froma aclass using the new keyword
//OurClass ourObject = new OurClass();

//// we can use the short-form method to create an object
//OurClass OuObject2 = new();

//// let's make a new instance!
//OurSecoundClass ourSecoundObject = new();
//ourSecoundObject.ExampleMethod();

//int result = ourSecoundObject.ExampleFunction();


//// where else have we seen classes and objects?
//// the console class!
//Console.WriteLine("This is a method on the console class!");

//// Console.writeline looks a little bit different.....
//// why didin't we have to create a new Console object?
//// we'll see why in a later lesson!

////objects are "reference types" in C#



//public class OurClass
//{
//};


//// rememeber the methods and functions we were creating?
//// we can now create methods and functions that are 
//// associated with a class!

//public class OurSecoundClass
//{
//    public void ExampleMethod()
//    {
//        Console.WriteLine("Hello from our method!");
//    }

//    public int ExampleFunction()
//    {
//        return 42;
//    }
//}

//// a method is a block of code that performs a specific task
//// we use methods to break our code into smaller, more manageable pieces!

//// here is an example of a method

//void ThisIsAMethod()
//{
//    //this is the body of the method
//}

//// we can call the method like this
//ThisIsAMethod();

////If we had code like the following, how might
//// we go make a method for it?
//Console.WriteLine("-------------");
//Console.WriteLine("New Example!");
//Console.WriteLine("-------------");

////we could make a method like this:

//void PrintSeperator()
//{
//    Console.WriteLine("-------------");
//}

//// and then call it line this
//PrintSeperator();
//Console.WriteLine("New Example!");
//PrintSeperator();

//// we could take it a step further and make ANOTHER
//// method that prints out the entire header

//void PrintHeader()
//{
//    PrintSeperator();
//    Console.WriteLine("New Example!");
//    PrintSeperator();
//}

//// and then call it like this
//PrintHeader();
